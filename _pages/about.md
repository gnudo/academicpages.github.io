Hi, I'm Goran Lovric, a physicist with a doctorate in biomedical engineering. Currently, I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher with the [Center of Biomedical Imaging](http://www.cibm.ch/) in the [X-ray Tomography Group](https://www.psi.ch/x-ray-tomography-group/) of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute).
