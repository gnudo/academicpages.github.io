Hi, I'm Goran Lovric, a physicist with a doctorate (PhD) in biomedical engineering. Currently, I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Center of Biomedical Imaging](http://www.cibm.ch/), within the *Phase contrast X-ray imaging core*, located at the [X-ray Tomography Group](https://www.psi.ch/x-ray-tomography-group/) of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute).
