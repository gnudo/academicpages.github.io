Hi, I'm Goran Lovric, a physicist with a doctorate (PhD) in biomedical engineering. Currently, I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Center of Biomedical Imaging](http://www.cibm.ch/), within the *Phase contrast X-ray imaging core*, located at the [X-ray Tomography Group](https://www.psi.ch/x-ray-tomography-group/) of the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute).

My main scientific interest revolves around X-ray tomographic imaging, in particular X-ray microscopy and phase-contrast imaging applied to dynamic biological systems. Thereby I've specialized in the field of *pulmonary imaging*, covering aspects such as experimental design, instrumentation, dosimetry, data acquisition as well as image processing and quantitative 3D image data analysis. My main scientific focus is *interdisciplinarity*, i.e. how to complement methodological expertise with biological and clinical relevance.

Apart from work and since February 2017, I am the father of two twin daugthers (*Justicia* and *Maris*). When I happen to have free time (which is rare these days), I enjoy [DJ](https://www.facebook.com/trussrecords/)-ing, movies, swimming and cycling.

*[father]: before that I obviously became the husband of their mum Nikolina.
